## Context and Problem Statement

The absence of a clear Code of Conduct can lead to various issues:

- **Unclear Behavioral Expectations**: Contributors may not know what is considered acceptable or unacceptable behavior, leading to misunderstandings and conflicts.

- **Hostile Environment**: Without guidelines, toxic behavior such as harassment, discrimination, and bullying can proliferate, driving away current and potential contributors.

- **Inefficient Conflict Resolution**: In the absence of predefined procedures, conflicts and reports of misconduct can be handled inconsistently, undermining trust in the project's governance.

- **Lack of Inclusivity**: Diverse voices may feel unwelcome or unsafe, limiting the diversity of perspectives and contributions, which is crucial for the robustness and innovation of the project.

- **Reputational Damage**: Incidents of misconduct can damage the project's reputation, deterring users and contributors and potentially jeopardizing partnerships and funding.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

- **Behavior Boundaries**:
  - Clearly outline what constitutes respectful and constructive interaction.
  - Specify behaviors that are not tolerated, such as harassment, discrimination, and personal attacks.
- **Reporting Mechanisms**: Establish straightforward procedures for reporting and addressing violations of the Code.
- **Inclusivity**: Encourage a culture of respect and inclusiveness, ensuring all contributors feel valued and safe.
- **Governance**: Strengthen the project's governance by providing a clear framework for handling conflicts and enforcing community standards.
